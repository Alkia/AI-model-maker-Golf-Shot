# AI model maker Golf Shot
 
I use Model Maker for Audio to Customize an Audio model and deploy on Android.
I use a custom golf shot dataset and export a TFLite model that can be used on a phone, a TensorFlow.JS model that can be used for inference in the browser and also a SavedModel version that you can use for serving.
